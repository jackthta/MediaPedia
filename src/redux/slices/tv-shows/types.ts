 * *1 â€” Optimization
 *      - Refresh TV Shows `shows` data every hour elapsed from:
 *          1. Initial page fetch timestamp
 *          2. Subsequent "refresh" fetch timestamps
 *      - `lastFetch` is set to each respective `Kind`'s
 *         state on _only_ (TV Shows or `Kind` TV Shows) pages mount.
 *      - "Refresh" means to:
 *          1. Fetch page 1 from `Kind` endpoint and replace that respective
 *             `Kind`'s `shows` and `page` properties (i.e. akin to an initial fetch).
 *          2. Clear `showsCache`.
