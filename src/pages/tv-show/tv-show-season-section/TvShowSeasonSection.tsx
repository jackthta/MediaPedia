// This comment used to be included when manually

// explcitly as an argument to the thunk function,
// but found out that the `createAsyncThunk` function
// includes the AbortController within its API:
// NOTE: Every fetch request needs to have its own
// unique instance of an AbortController. If this was
// initialized in the component function scope and that
// instance is passed into different dispatched fetch
// requests, one `abort()` invokation _anywhere_ using
// that instance will cancel _all_ occurring fetch requests where
// that instance was passed through as the AbortController.
